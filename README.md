## About RIFT
![alt text](https://github.com/crussong/rift/blob/main/assets/images/logo_rift_white_400px.png "RIFT logo")

RIFT is a lightweight, browser-based application designed to support tabletop roleplaying sessions with minimal setup and maximum immediacy.

The core idea behind RIFT is a fast game start. Instead of complex configuration, accounts, or preparation steps, the application is ready to use the moment it is opened. All functionality is available locally in the browser, without a backend, build process, or external dependencies. This allows RIFT to be used offline and keeps all data under direct user control.

## Design Philosophy

RIFT is built around three main principles:

- Immediate usability without onboarding or setup
- Clear separation of features into focused modules
- Long-term maintainability through simple, transparent technology

The application deliberately avoids framework complexity and feature overload in favor of reliability, clarity, and speed.

## Core Modules

### Characters
The character module provides structured character sheets designed for quick access during play. Information is organized for readability and fast reference, allowing players and game masters to retrieve relevant details without breaking the flow of the session.

### Notes
The notes module is a lightweight space for freeform text, reminders, and session-related thoughts. It is intentionally unstructured and optimized for fast writing, making it suitable for capturing ideas without interrupting gameplay.

### Chat
The chat module provides a simple in-application communication channel. It is designed for quick exchanges, dice callouts, or short coordination messages without relying on external chat tools.

### Dice
The dice module allows instant in-browser dice rolls without external tools or physical dice. It is built for speed and minimal interaction to support the pacing of live sessions.

### Whiteboard
The whiteboard module offers a minimal visual space for sketches, positioning, or quick explanations. It is intentionally kept simple and flexible rather than feature-rich.

### Map
The map module provides a lightweight way to reference or display locations relevant to the session. It supports orientation and spatial context without introducing complex mapping workflows.

## Technical Overview

RIFT runs entirely on the client side and is implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No server, account system, or third-party services are required. All data is stored locally in the browser, enabling offline use and ensuring that session data remains private and fully user-controlled.

## Project Status

RIFT is an actively developed personal project. Features and structure may evolve over time, with a continued focus on simplicity, fast access, and a frictionless start to play.
