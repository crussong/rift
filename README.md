## ⚡ Why RIFT?

**Because your session shouldn't wait for your tools.**

Most tabletop apps want you to sign up, configure settings, watch tutorials, and sync accounts before you even roll your first die. RIFT takes a different approach:

> **Open → Create Room → Play.** That's it.

No accounts. No installations. No friction. Just you, your party, and the adventure.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

RIFT is built on three pillars:

### 1. Speed First
Every interaction is optimized for minimal clicks and instant feedback. Hover-prefetching, service worker caching, and lightweight code ensure the app feels native-fast.

### 2. Zero Friction
No sign-ups, no tutorials, no configuration wizards. If a feature needs explanation, it's redesigned until it doesn't.

### 3. Focused Simplicity
Each module does one thing well. No feature bloat, no hidden menus, no "pro tiers". Everything is available to everyone, immediately.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

RIFT runs entirely in the browser with no build step required:

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Real-time Sync:** Firebase Realtime Database
- **Hosting:** Netlify (with automatic pretty URLs)
- **Domain & DNS:** Cloudflare
- **PWA:** Service Worker + Web App Manifest

No React. No Vue. No webpack. Just fast, maintainable code that works.

---

## 🌍 Language

RIFT is currently available in **German only**. The entire UI, all text, and documentation within the app are in German. International language support may be considered in the future.

---
